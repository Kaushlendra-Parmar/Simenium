## üì¶ Deployment Steps

1. **Final Commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: finalize performance optimizations and deployment readiness"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify GitHub Actions**
   - Check workflow completion
   - Verify no deployment errors
   - Confirm GitHub Pages site update

4. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Test live site performance
   - Verify all models load correctly
   - Check mobile compatibility
   - Test error handling scenarios

## üîç Performance Metrics

### Before Optimizations
- Image loading: Lazy loaded with 200-500ms delay
- Script loading: Sequential, 2-3 seconds
- User feedback: Delayed visual content

### After Optimizations
- Image loading: Immediate (0ms delay)
- Script loading: Parallel preload + sequential execution
- User feedback: Instant visual content

## üéØ Success Criteria
